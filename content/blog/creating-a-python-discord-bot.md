#### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating a Discord bot using Python. Discord is a popular platform for gamers and communities to communicate, and creating a bot can enhance your server's functionality in various ways.

#### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- Discord.py library (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You'll also need a Discord account and permissions to create a bot and add it to a server.

#### Steps

1. Set Up a Discord Application
   - Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
   - Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot".
   - Customize your bot's name, profile picture, etc., as desired.

2. Get Your Bot's Token
   - In the "Bot" tab of your application, you'll find a "Token" section. Click "Copy" to copy your bot's token.

3. Install Discord.py
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install the Discord.py library:

```bash
pip install discord.py
```

4. Write Your Bot Code
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., bot.py) and open it in your favorite text editor.
   - Write your bot's code using Discord.py. Here's a simple example to get you started

```python
# bot.py

import discord

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('Logged in as {0.user}'.format(client))

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    if message.content.startswith('!hello'):
        await message.channel.send('Hello!')

client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE')
```

Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE' with the token you copied earlier.

5. Run Your Bot
    - Save your Python file.
    - Run the following command in your terminal to start your bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

Your bot should now be online and responding to commands in your Discord server!
