# Portfolio Website

I always wanted to create a portfolio mainly because it's very important to share your work with others as a developer, I'm no huge developer by any means, yet. But still, I think it is very important to share your work. 

Another reason why I started developing this portfolio is I wanted to be good at writing technical reports and blogs. In this industry, developers need to be extremely good at writing reports because it's a huge part of this job.
